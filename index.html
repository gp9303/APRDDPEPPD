    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>At the end of 1953, a team of young men placed as a dream and objective, the foundation of an association with national and athletic aims based on promoting the education and social skills of its young members.<br> On 14 April 1954, the general assembly of these members with leader Mr Christakis Pavlides proposes the foundation of an athletic association called "APOLLON LIMASSOL".<br> The assembly approved the proposal and thus from that date "APOLLON was born".<br> The first administrative council of the team included: Charalambos Lymbourides (Secretary), Andreas Psyllides (Cashier), Antonakis Fourlas (Adviser), Melis Charalampous (Adviser), Andreas Theoharous (Adviser) Andreas Aggelopoulos (Adviser) and Kostas Panayiotou (Adviser).<br>

In its first year, Apollon had eight defeats in eight matches in the second division.<br> Just before the next season (1956–57), Apollon won the regional group in the second division and subsequently the play-offs and then was promoted to the first division.

This took place in 1957 and ever since Apollon has been competing in the first division.<br> Through its history, Apollon won four Championships (1991, 1994, 2006, 2022), nine Cups (1966, 1967, 1986, 1992, 2001, 2010, 2013, 2016, 2017), three Super Cup (2006, 2016, 2017) and also had some very successful participation in European competitions, winning several important games and at the same time, the respect of many European football clubs during the several participations in the Group Stage of the Europa League</p>

    <h2>1954–1955:early years</h2>

    <p>In its first year, Apollon suffered eight defeats in eight matches in the second division.<br> Just before the next season (1956–57), Apollon won the regional group in the second division and subsequently the play-offs and then was promoted to the first division. This took place in 1957 and ever since Apollon has been competing in the first division.<br> Things were not easy however for the newly promoted club. Apollon couldn't reach a satisfactory position in the rankings and was struggling in the middle of the table for many years. But in the mid-60's things changed.</p>

    <h2>1964–1967:the first distinctions</h2>
    
    <p>In 1965 Apollon reached the Cup Final. However, Omonia won the title with a score of 5–1.<br> A year later, Apollon was in the Final again, and won the Cup by defeating Nea Salamina with the score of 4–2 (Scorers: Panikos Yiolitis, Andros Konstantinou, Panikkos Krystallis, Antonis Panayides), and triumphantly took the trophy to Limassol.<br> Apollon managed to maintain its Cup title in 1967, by beating Alki 1–0 thanks to the goal of Antonis Panayides.<br> After celebrating these titles, Apollon had to wait another 15 years to start making history once again.</p>

    
    
    <h2>1981–1987:back to the Cup final after 20 fallow years</h2>
    <p>In the football season 1981–82 Apollon managed to reach once again the Cup final however in double games Omonia won the Cup.<br> In the 1985–86 season, after 20 years of "drought" Apollon won once again the Cup in Tsirion Stadium, overcoming APOEL with a score of 2–0.Scores were Kenny and Sokratous.</p>


    <h2>1990–1999: 10 years of glory</h2>

    <p>In these years, it emerged clearly that absent was this "something" that could make the difference for the team to lead in the Championship. This "something" therefore was non-other than the German coach named Diethelm Ferner who, upon arriving in Cyprus was determined to win.<br> The German, with his discipline and hard work accomplishes "links" between young talented footballers with older more experienced footballers creating a team ready for the big time.<br> Thus in the season 1990–91 the team entered the championship "marathon" wanting to write the biggest and most glorious page in its history book.<br> After a frantic and impressive season, offering both substance and spectacle in its game, Apollon was finally crowned Champion of Cyprus! From that year and for a five-year period the team gained the admiration of all Cypriot football fans after playing modern football.<br> In 1991–92 season Apollon won the Cup for the fourth time, overcoming Omonia in final with a final score of 1–0. The scorer was Evgenio Ptak.<br> However, in the next season of 1992–93 Apollon lost both titles.<br> The team returned strongly and gained the club's second Championship one year later in the 1993–94 season, later after a hard duel with Anorthosis where the title was judged on the last day of the season.<br> In the 1994–95 season Apollon reached the Cup final losing to APOEL with 2–4 while the same happened also in the 1997–98 season with "executioner" this time the almighty Anorthosis, that accomplishes and gains the cup with a final score 1–3.<br> In that five-year period Apollon was accomplished in the European ties, winning enough games and at the same time the respect of many European football clubs.<br> However, the game, in which Apollon wrote his own unique history is non-other than with the big opponent of Inter Milan in the UEFA Cup! The 1–0 in "Stadio Giuseppe Meazza" (San Siro) left margins for Apollon to believe in a miracle, against the Italians for the second leg game of 3 November 1993. The Cup Champions, staffed with a squad of international players led by Dutchman Dennis Bergkamp talked for a walkover in Cyprus against "fishermen" (thus called the footballers of Apollon the goalkeeper of Inter, Walter Zenga before the game) and that the game in Milan was just a bad game for their team.<br> However, the Inter team was found in Limassol, losing in the first ten minutes with a 0–2 score and only finally managed to recover and to finish another historic tie with 3–3, leaving at the end the great Italian goalkeeper speechless!. Scorers for the Apollon team were Milenko Špoljarić, Slađan Šćepović and Giorgos Iosifidis.</p>

    <h2>2000–2010: 1 championship, 2 cups and 1 super cup</h2>

    <p>In the 2000–01 season Apollon won the cup against Nea Salamis Famagusta in the GSP stadium, with final score 1–0. Scorer was the unforgettable Viktor Zubarev.<br>

In the middle of the football season (2004–05) and after enough failed attempts for glory after the final of 2001, German manager Bernd Stange took the responsibility, accomplishing late but regularly he brought back the lost glamour of the team. In the season, 2005–06 Apollon won the league title undefeated and earned a club record of 64 points. Apollon had 19 wins and 7 draws in 26 matches and this went down in Cypriot Football history, due to fact that it was the fourth team in the Cyprus Championship that won the title unbeaten (*Apollon was the only undefeated team in Europe, running an unbeaten streak since 12 March 2005 (30 games). The next year Apollon won for the first time in his history the Super Cup beating APOEL 1–3 at home.<br>

In 2010 Apollon won the Cup after 9 years (2001 Final Cup), beating APOEL Nicosia in GSZ Stadium. The final score was 2–1.</p>

    <h2>2010–11: cup finalists</h2>

    <p>The following year (2011), Apollon reached the final of the Cypriot Cup for the second consecutive year, but lost to Omonia on penalties, after a 1–1 draw following extra time</p>
